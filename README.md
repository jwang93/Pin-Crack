##### About 

Studies show that having one universal PIN for all uses is incredibly dangerous. Thus, it can be a real pain keeping track of all PINs. From bank accounts to smartphones to library cards, it's easy to get all the digits mixed up - and that can be annoying. 

Pin Crack is a secure tool that generates educated guesses as to what your PIN is. Enter in your guess and assign a confidence to each digit. Through our algorithm, Pin Crack takes these inputs and generates the combinations with the highest chance of success. 

Note: We will never store any of your data. Please use responsibly. 


##### How It Works

1. Enter the individual digits to the guessed PIN
2. Assign a confidence (1-5) to each digit. This confidence is based on your certainty of the digit's correctness in value and position. 

Pin Crack's accuracy is heavily contingent on an honest representation of confidence. Ideally, the target is to have at least two digits with a confidence of 4-5. Higher confidence leads to better guesses.
